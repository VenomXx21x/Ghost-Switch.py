Tor Network Integration: GhostSwitch uses the Tor network to route all traffic through anonymous servers, hiding your real IP address.

IP Rotation: The tool sends a command to the Tor service (via the ControlPort) to change your IP address periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds).

Secure Proxy: Your applications or browser are configured to use Tor's SOCKS5 proxy, ensuring all data is encrypted and anonymized.

Result: Each IP change makes it harder to track your online activity, enhancing your privacy and security.

In essence, GhostSwitch automates the process of using Tor for anonymous browsing and adds periodic IP rotation for extra privacy.
